# UnitySettings
Runtime debugging menu (like setting on Android) for Unity.

## About this plugin
Every single Unity projects have *lots of* debugging purpose features.
The sad thing is, this kind of codes are just for one time use, even if these are not just project-specific codes.
So after use these codes, we usally just throw away.
For preventing invent-a-wheel again and again, we decided to collect all the general purpose debugging features into one single plugin.

## The Final Form of Plugin, We Hope
* It will be similar to Android Settings menu.
* You will use these plugin just by add single DLL file.
* You will open runtime-debugging menu by a single gesture, like draw circle.

## What Features, For Example?
We will ship general purpose runtime debugging features!

* Network monitering tool/simulator
