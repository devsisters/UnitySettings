# UnitySettings
Runtime debugging menu (like setting on Android) for Unity.

## About this plugin
Every single Unity projects have *lots of* debugging purpose features.
The sad thing is, these kind of codes are just for one time use, even if these are not just project-specific codes.
So usally after use these codes, these are just discarded.
For preventing invent-a-wheel again and again, we decided to collect all the general purpose debugging features into one single plugin.

## The Final Form of Plugin, We Hope
* It will be similar to Android Settings menu.
* You will use this plugin just by add a single DLL file.
* You will open runtime-debugging menu by gesture, like draw circle.
* You will simply add your own view by few API call.
* Or you will plugin in your own code in github repository.

## What Features, For Example?
We will ship plenty of general purpose runtime debugging features!
* Extensible CLI parser/executer
* LUA repl for UnityEngine.dll
* Device information
* Build information
* Account information
* Log viewer
* Touch infomation, with visualization
* Network monitering tool/simulator
* Scene changer/monitering tool
* PlayerPrefs modifier/viewer
* Sound controller
